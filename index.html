   </div>

   <div class="mostPop">
   	<p>You&rsquo;ve probably seen pictures on Facebook and other sites of &lsquo;Digital Nomads&rsquo;.</p>
   	<p>These are people who run online businesses, meaning that they&rsquo;re able to work from anywhere in the world – as long as they have a laptop.</p>
   	<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what they do: they take that laptop and they head off to travel far-flung corners of the world.</p>
   	<p>Being a digital nomad means being <em>truly </em>free.</p>
   	<p>It means being able to work from a beach while sipping a cocktail and it means being able to do whatever you want, whenever you want to, because you don&rsquo;t have a boss breathing down your neck!</p>
